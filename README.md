# LoRa-Based-Water-Pump-Automation
Welcome to my small project in which i automate one of my most repeated tasks of the day, that being turning the pump switch on and off multiple times a day to keep my home's water tank full of water.
I used esp32s, lora modules, a relay switch to automate it.
Also the entire system is remotely controllable as well if manual override is ever reauired remotely.
