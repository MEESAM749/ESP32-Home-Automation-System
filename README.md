# 🏠 Home Automation using ESP32 + LoRa

Welcome to my humble little chaos machine — a DIY water pump automation and control setup using ESP32 and long-range LoRa communication.  
You can automate or control a wide range of electrical appliances — **as long as you’re using components rated for your specific application** (e.g., proper relays for high voltage).
