# LoRa-Based-Water-Pump-Automation
Welcome to my small project, where I automate one of my most frequently repeated daily tasksâ€”turning the pump switch on and off multiple times a day to keep my home's water tank full.  
I used an ESP32, LoRa modules, and a relay switch to automate the process. The entire system is also remotely controllable, allowing for manual override if needed.  
I will upload the required code, circuit schematics, and a working demo in about a week. I am currently in the testing phase, with a few final checks remaining before I release everything.
